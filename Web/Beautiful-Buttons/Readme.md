## Description

Hello hackers! I’ve developed a new app to showcase your design skills. This time, I’ve learned from my previous mistakes and made it unhackable. Do you think you can crack it and reveal the secret?  
**Pro tip**: Try this challenge locally first. Once your exploit is successful, then give it a shot on the remote instance (you can thank me later!).
