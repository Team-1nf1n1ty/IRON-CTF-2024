description: "I forgot to ask my friend for the password to access the secret webpage, and now he's unavailable. I've tried guessing the password, but it's been unsuccessful. My friend is very security-conscious, so he wouldn't use an easy-to-guess password. He's also an Emmet enthusiast who relies heavily on code generation shortcuts. Can you help me figure out how to access the secret webpage?<br><b>Author</b>: `AbdulHaq`"
